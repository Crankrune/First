### Notes

- Top female streamer is #10 overall, rest of top 10 is male with the exception of CriticalRole, a group of men and women
- All the top 6 overall are 100k+, #1 is 283k (Ludwig)
- Top 20 only has 2 women, top 50 has 3 women, and top 100 has 6
- These are peak subscriber numbers, not active/current (though given Ironmouse's record is recent, hers would be)
- Kkatamina lost nearly all of her subs by the next month, going from 73k to just 1.7k
- Pokimane currently has only 8k, and outside of the record month she's only hit about 12k
- Pokimane's peak sub count is also odd, as it seems to have been about 2/3 Prime subs, accounting for nearly 20k of the subs
- Amouranth is at 17k currently, she has sustained high-teens and low-twenties since April 2021
- In numbers of current active subs the ranking from 1-5 is Casimito, Ironmouse, xQc, Hasanabi, Nickmercs. Ranging from 93k to 54k.
- Ludwig left Twitch for YouTube with about 25k active subs. From July 2020 to December 2021 he averaged 25K or more active subs, with the notable exceptions of the two months he did the subathon where he was over 100k
- Ninja currently has about 9.5k subs. Since his return to Twitch in September 2020 he has only hit about 12k active subs, except for that first month back where he peaked at 26k.
- Ninja's peak was basically the whole year of 2018. He had about 5 months with more than 100k subs, 2 of those over 200k, and another at 195k. Quick glance seems that no one has gotten close to this outside of him, as Ludwig only sustained 100K for 2 months, with that peak of 283k. Ninja's single peak 269k.

- Men are clearly making far more on average than women. The top woman has only made \$1.8M in 2 years, while about 10 men have made \$3.0M+, the top 5 being \$5.0M+
- In the top 10 there are no women (outside of a group), the top 25 still has no women, and the top 50 only bring it to 3 women
