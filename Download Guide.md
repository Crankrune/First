# Download Guide

 *Links for anything and everything you'll want!*

## Movies & TV

[RapidMoviez](rmz.cr) - Mainly for TV Shows, you'll find better versions of movies on other sites I list. Look for episodes by "RMTeam" that are "480p" either "WEB/WEBRip/WEB-DL". I'd recommend using either the Openload or RapidRar links.

[Pahe.in](pahe.in) - Movies & TV shows in both 480p & 720p. I recommend using either MG (MEGA) or OL (Openload) links to download.

[MkvCage](mkvcage.ws) - Movies & TV Shows in 720p. Has torrents and direct download links, I recommend using Openload from the "Watch Online" links. The password for any links is "mkvcage".

[WatchCartoonOnline](watchcartoononline.io) - Cartoons, Anime Subtitled & Dubbed. To download I recommend using the Chrome extension "FlashVideoDownloader", start playing and episode, then click on the extension icon (a blue download arrow). Then you can either download through Chrome, or copy the link into Jdownloader.

## Android Apps

[Mobilism](http://mobilism.org) - Paid apps and games. As well as many books, magazines and audiobooks. *Huge* selection of apps and books. You need to register, but it's free.

[Android-Zone](http://android-zone.ws) - Paid android apps and games. 

## Music

[SMLoadr](https://git.fuwafuwa.moe/SMLoadrDev/SMLoadr) - Command line tool to download music from Deezer. Link should have instructions. You'll need a Deezer account, a free one is all you'll need.
