### Recommended Tools

**uBlock Origin | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)** - Adblocker, the one I always use. Very helpful for many of the sites I'll be linking to here.

_**uBlock Filter Lists**_
These will extend the functionality of uBlock and help it block unwanted things.

- _EasyList_
EasyList is the primary filter list that removes most adverts from international webpages, including unwanted frames, images and objects. It is the most popular list used by many ad blockers and forms the basis of over a dozen combination and supplementary filter lists.
[View EasyList](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt) or [add it to your ad blocker](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt&title=EasyList)

- _Fanboy's Annoyance List_
Fanboy's Annoyance List blocks Social Media content, in-page pop-ups and other annoyances; thereby substantially decreasing web page loading times and uncluttering them. EasyList Cookie List and Fanboy's Social Blocking List are already included, there is no need to subscribe to them if you already have Fanboy's Annoyance List.

**[Bypass Paywalls](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome)** - Bypass Paywalls is a web browser extension to help bypass paywalls for selected sites. For news sites, can be helpful.

**[Video DownloadHelper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lmjnegcaeklhafolokijcfjliaokphfk)** - For downloading videos embded in webpages, can also be used to copy the links to something like JDownloader. Some of the sites I'll be linking to you made need/want this to download things from them.

### Movies & TV

**[pahe.ph](https://pahe.ph/)** - Really good site for compressed HD movies and tv shows. Mostly in 720p, with movies being available in 1080p and occasionally 4k.

**[psarips](https://psa.pm/category/tv-show/)** - x265/HEVC TV and movies, smaller file sizes and good quality. A source I regularly use and have sent you links from as well.

**[RapidMoviez](https://rmz.cr/)** - Large selction of TV and movies. Some things you won't find elsewhere, including things like daytime and late night shows. In varying qualities from 480p to 1080p, and could be HDTV or WEB versions.

### E-Books, Audiobooks, and Comics

**[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)** - For older books that may be public domain. Large collection, all free, and in various formats.

**[Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/texts)** - Has books and collections from many sources, most should be free but some may require a sign up. Also has several audiobooks.

**[Library Genesis](https://libgen.fun/)** - The place for school related and educational books, one of the most popular sites. Should have plenty of textbooks and other educational books.

**[z-lib](https://z-lib.org/) | [Books](https://u1lib.org/), [Articles](https://booksc.org/)** - Really good collection of books, my go to site for non-eductional stuff like fiction or non-fiction books. The articles thing seems interesting, but I haven't used it so :man_shrugging:

**[AudioBookBay](http://audiobookbay.nl/)** - Seems to be a really large collection of audiobooks. Not sure how many of these you'll be able to download, some of them are in torrent files. But worth looking at either way.

**[Mobilism.org](https://forum.mobilism.org/index.php)** - Forum with mostly android apps but also a lot of audiobooks. All will be direct downloads so should work well. You will need to register, but I believe it's free so should be fine.

### _Distracting_ Stuff

**[Influencers Gonewild](https://influencersgonewild.com/)** - Image collections and some videos of many OF girls, updated often.

**[gotanynudes](https://gotanynudes.com/)** - Mostly videos with some image collections of OF and TikTok girls primarliy. Updated often.

**[ProThots](https://prothots.com/)** - Very similar to gotanynudes, some overlap in content, but also unique things.

**[PornTN](http://porntn.com/)** - Video site with lots of OF girls, full videos, decent quality.
